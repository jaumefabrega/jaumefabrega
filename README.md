# I'm Jaume, nice to meet you ðŸ˜Š

I'm a Full-stack Developer with a focus on the JavaScript ecosystem. I have experience with React, Redux, AngularJS, Express, Koa, Node, GraphQL, SQL (Postgres) and NoSQL (MongoDB).

I also have experience in Python, mainly for web development (Django) and some machine learning (Scikit-learn), computer vision (OpenCV) and web scraping (BeautifulSoup and Selenium).

I have a background in business and a passion for tech and computer programming. I am a self-motivated learner who loves to build new things. Outside of work, I enjoy watching movies, reading about new topics and mingling with people.
